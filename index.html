   Good evening ZxG!
It’s been quite some time since we have made a major announcement, however we are extremely pleased to inform you guys of ZxG x DA! 
DA (Drift Andreas) is a community that is currently based on RAGE:Multiplayer, and like us, have evolved from what was previously a renowned SA-MP community.
Please stay tuned to our server for further updates as we continue on this path to provide a brand new RAGE:Multiplayer server filled with never-seen-before features and characteristics, just for YOU! The server has currently also been released for the RAGE:Multiplayer Alpha version. 

Despite our long absence, we are extremely excited that things are now well on track to make this community thrive once again. Naturally, we will expect most of you to join us again and do what we all have grown up doing – mastering the art of GTA drift and fulfilling our ultimate car fantasies.
Last but not the least, and certainly most importantly, we have missed all of you. Gone are the days when we would all hop on the ZxG SA-MP server and take part in so many exclusive events, or perhaps just slide our cars down the Big Ear, or maybe show off our ‘steerl0ck’ skills at San Fierro and the Las Venturas International Airport; but now its time to move on to bigger and better things that await us at Los Santos! We are sure we are not the only ones who miss hanging out together, and henceforth will be awaiting your presence eagerly at the ZxG RAGE:Multiplayer server launch!
Please welcome to our management & development teams!
  </p>
